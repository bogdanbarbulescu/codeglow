*   **Code Snippet Generation:**
    *   Generates clean HTML structure for the selected component.
    *   Generates corresponding CSS with:
        *   Clearly defined CSS Custom Properties (`:root` variables) for easy theme integration.
        *   Mode-specific styles.
        *   Basic interaction styles (`:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`).
    *   Copy-to-clipboard functionality for the full HTML+CSS snippet.

    *   **Themes:** Apply predefined style configurations (primarily for Glow mode currently).
    *   **Random Accent:** Generate a random accent color for inspiration.
    *   **Reset All:** Revert all settings (page, component, font, etc.) back to their defaults.
